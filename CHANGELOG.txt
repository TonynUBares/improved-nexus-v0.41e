iNexus-v0.x
- Made Nexus fully compatible with GZdoom 
- Made Nexus compatibile with CF4.2.4+ and all the available gzdoom mod patches
- Removed every single fucking blyat console error that these cursed addons had!
- Included NemesisHellsmith addon
- Made weapons use the Reload and Zoom keys (no more Altfire to reload and RailgunAction to zoom)
- Reworked 95% of the ACS scripts 
   Nexmas was blyat. Now it's fine and shouldn't annoy servers anymore
   DemonHeart check, use and drop now work as intended (i.e. they work)
   PowerRegenItems scripts were reworked to use the same system of CF4.2+ (items cooldowns listed in LANGUAGE.extra)
   TXS crates scripts reworked to look better
   Marines scripts reworked a bit better
- Reworked OccultSpellbook
    Added new interactive Altfire menu (update: now with mouse movement)
    Added two new sounds for the Altfire menu
    Bound every mode to a different key (Altfire, Zoom, Reload, Grenade, Mine)
- Reworked Skulltag runes
   They are optional (via CVar option)
   You can carry maximum 3 in your inventory (like in Pandemonia)
   You can use only one per time
   You can remove the one you're using by using twice another rune in your inventory
- Reworked Armors to work like CF4.2+
   Every armor has 25% absorption and custom DF
   Picking up a better armor replaces the current one
   Picking up an armor with more points than your current one doesn't replace it if yours is of a better type
     (example: RedArmor would replenish up to 250 points your LegArmor that had only 100 points left, without replacing the armor type)
   Armor can be dropped and it will "remember" how many points it had left
   FFS don't overwrite or replace any armor with anything not working the same way. This system is cool AF
   It's like Clusterfuck but in 2152; stop modding like you live in the Middle Age.
- Made (some) weapons use CF4.2+ SpreadRune (working in gzdoom too)
- Improv(ing)ed SBARINFO
- Moved all monster tags to LANGUAGE.tags (helps for gzdoom hpbars, like crosshairhp, and CCards and for translations)
- ^^^ Same for pickup messages, menu options, item tags (ongoing)
- Added missing tags to some items
- Killed every possible instance of SETSLOT inside KEYCONF lumps (DON'T EVER DARE GOING BACK TO KEYCONF)
   Each weapon now has SlotNumber and Priority properties defined (helps with gzdoom weapon mods compatibility)
- Added LANGUAGE.spawners (for CF4.2+ progressive spawners compatibility)
- Added LANGUAGE.BSSpawners (original Nexus random spawn chances)
- Added LANGUAGE.XMAS (so presents don't use a crappy-ish script and don't desynch online anymore)
- Fixed whatever was breaking Eviternity's weather (100 rubles to whoever else finds the problem :D)
- Removed Unmaker (it was reworked by TonynUBares and added to CF4.2+)
   Also removed every instance of Unmaker (including the crates and shuffle drops)
   Unmaker now has its own D64-inspired system
- Added a CCARDS lump, because why not
- Rework(ing)ed Hackroid boys
   Balanced (partially)
   New attack mechanic for the Zombie (the HackroFuck)
   New attack mechanic for the Captain (soon)
- Balanced (partially) Nemesis Hellsmith
- Fixed a very serious server-fucking problem with SinGenjitsu3
   Rework SGActiveScript to work as it probably was intended to
- Rework(ing)ed Hackroid Weapons:
   They hack the system and don't consume ammo anymore
   They hack the HUD and the statusbar and show TV-static-like in place of the ammo
- Reworked Beacons to make full use of Gaturra's sprites
   They now show their "loading" bar that fills to 100% when they are ready to spawn more stuff
   They will play the beep/alarm sound when ready, not when you step on them and they are not ready
- Converted all chests into switchable decorations (press use to open them)
