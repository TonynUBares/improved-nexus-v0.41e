!PLEASE NOTE!

PLEASE DO NOT MOD ON TOP OF THIS PROJECT, INSTEAD MAKE A NEW SEPARATE FILE!

If you want to use any of the mod's resources, make sure to include the proper
credits with all the details listed in the CREDITS txt file.
If you DON'T provide with any credits, you will not be permitted to use the mod's content.
(If possible, i'd highly recommend you let me know first via Discord before taking action)


!PLEASE NOTE THIS AS WELL! [TonynUBares]

1) A recommendation is not an obligation :D.
2) I kept every credit that originally were in the Nexus file. No content has been stolen: I didn't make any of the
content in this mod and I'm not saying otherwise. All I did is clearly described in the CREDITS file.
3) I DID NOT DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAT WHAT WAS DONE FOR NEXUS 1.95: INCLUDING ALL THE FILES MENTIONED 
ABOVE (NONE OF THEM OWNED BY THE PEOPLE THAT COOPERATED FOR NEXUS). If people aren't willing to understand this,
then they should stop talking shit about me, stop being childish af and stop talking like if I'm a nazi that is
doing a "war" and propaganda against them.
4) Clusterfuck 4.1 is obsolete. The owners abandoned it and people who like playing it should be glad that others
kept it alive, fixing bugs, fixing problems that made online servers crash and leak RAM and adding new features.
